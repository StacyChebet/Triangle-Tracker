## Description
Triangle tracker is an easy-to-use web page that lets the user enter the 3 sides of triangles in 3 separate input fields and after clicking the 'Determine' button, the result is displayed based on the input i.e.:
1. Whether the triangle is equilateral by checking whether all the 3 sides of the triangle are equal. For example, when the user inputs 3,3,3 in the 3 input fields, the expected output is 'Equilateral triangle'.
2. Whether the triangle is isosceles by checking whether any 2 of the 3 sides of the triangle are equal. For example, when the user inputs 3,3,5 in the 3 input fields, the expected output is 'Isosceles triangle'.
3. Whether the triangle is scalene by determining that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side. For example, when the user inputs 2,3,5 in the 3 input fields, the expected output is 'Scalene triangle'.
4. If there is an invalid entry e.g. a letter, the expected output is "Invalid entry".
